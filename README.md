### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## About me
Hi, I'm abdullah chaudhry, a master's degree computer engineer from the University of Florence. I am a citizen of the world, I speak three different languages: Italian, English and Urdu. **I mostly use Python**, but I also got to try **Java, C#, Arduino and more**. 

I have developed a broad knowledge in different sectors: from deep learning (âš¡**Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow**âš¡) to the backend with Django, from IoT with Arduino to the development of software for VR devices (âš¡**Unity, C#, Oculus Quest**âš¡). I also had the opportunity to develop an app for Android and Ios (âš¡**Ionic Framework, Angular, Cordova**âš¡).

Outside the world of the tech, I read books (psychological novels in particular), I like to fraw portraits. 
I always try to keep fit through various physical activities such as Yoga. Lately I've been getting into cooking, especially cakes.
