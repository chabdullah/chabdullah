## üå± About me
Hi, I'm Abdullah Chaudhry, a master's degree computer engineer from the University of Florence. I am a citizen of the world, I speak three different languages: Italian, English and Urdu. **I mostly use Python**, but I also got to try **Java, C#, Arduino and more**. 

I have developed a broad knowledge in different sectors: from deep learning (**Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow**) to the backend with Django, from IoT with Arduino to the development of software for VR devices (**Unity, C#, Oculus Quest**). I also had the opportunity to develop an app for Android and iOS (**Ionic Framework, Typescript, Angular, Cordova**).

### üî≠ Technical skills:
- Languages: Python, Java, C, HTML/CSS, TypeScript, C#, LaTex, Arduino
- Developer Tools: Eclipse, Clion, Pycharm, WebStorm, VS Code, Unity, Shell, Arduino IDE
- Technologies/Frameworks: Linux, Ionic, Angular, Cordova, Bootstrap, Django, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Pytorch, Django, Chart.js, NetworkX, Pandas, Numpy, Google Firebase

### üòÑ Main projects
- [Protein subcellular localization](https://github.com/chabdullah/Protein-subcellular-localization) *| NLP, ELMo, LSTM Attention*
- [Blue Blueberries - a cookbook application](https://github.com/chabdullah/Blue-Blueberries) *| Ionic framework with Angular, Cordova, Google Firebase*
- [Cindy‚Äôs Bad Luck - a Basic Life Support simulator VR](https://github.com/chabdullah/Cindy-s-Bad-Luck-BLS-VR) *| Unity, C#*
- [COVID-19-analysis](https://github.com/chabdullah/COVID-19-analysis) *| Python, NetworkX, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy*

### ‚ö° Job related skills:
- Good knowledge on the functioning of Data Mining techniques and Document Mining. Ability to critically analyze e
develop algorithms and methods for the efficient management of large amounts of data.
- Good knowledge of the theoretical concepts of Human-Computer Interaction for the development of a user interface for
Android devices.
- Good knowledge of object-oriented programming. Philosophy implemented in different languages such as Java, Python
and C#.
- Good knowledge of the various Python modules aimed at data analysis.
- Good knowledge of IoT devices such as Arduino.
- Understanding of the scientific principles underlying the efficient, reliable and secure transmission of data knowing how
to apply the fundamental theoretical principles (mathematical, cryptographic and algorithmic) at the basis of data
protection.
- Good knowledge of machine learning techniques (Deep Learning).
- Always eager and ready to learn new tools and acquire new knowledge (always self-taught).


### üçì Other
Outside the world of the tech, I read books (psychological novels in particular), I like to draw portraits. 
I always try to keep fit through various physical activities such as Yoga. Lately I've been getting into cooking, especially cakes.
