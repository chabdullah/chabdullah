## üå± About me
Hi, I'm Abdullah Chaudhry, a master's degree computer engineer from the University of Florence. I am a citizen of the world, I speak three different languages: Italian, English and Urdu. **I mostly use Python**, but I also got to try **Java, C#, Arduino and more**. 

I have developed a broad knowledge in different sectors: from deep learning (**Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow**) to the backend with Django, from IoT with Arduino to the development of software for VR devices (**Unity, C#, Oculus Quest**). I also had the opportunity to develop an app for Android and iOS (**Ionic Framework, Typescript, Angular, Cordova**).
